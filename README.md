# mono_and_depth_image_attitude_estimator

This code is based on [charlesCXK/RGBD_Semantic_Segmentation_PyTorch](https://github.com/charlesCXK/RGBD_Semantic_Segmentation_PyTorch) and [Hibiki1020/classification_attitude_estimator](https://github.com/Hibiki1020/classification_attitude_estimator). Feature extraction module is based on former, and output layer is based on latter.

This code can inference camera attitude from mono and depth image using DNN.
